# Tasks for CEBRA-Based Data Processing Pipeline for Mapping Time-Locked EEG Paired Sets in Interacting Participants

This repository contains solutions to the CEBRA-Based Data Processing Pipeline evaluation tasks for the GSoC 2025 project under ML4SCI. The project explores mapping neural dynamics within dyads  to uncover neural patterns underlying communication and Exploring differences in feature spaces.

üìÑ Dataset Description: The Dataset consists of participant data (rows) of two classes (marked in last column), reflecting different metabolic states. Features (columns) of band power (in theta, delta, alpha, beta, and gamma ranges) have been extracted from a 64-channel EEG recording (you are welcome to use topological information for classification, taking into account that channels are not independent, to improve your results ‚Äì [channel distribution figure](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Flh7-rt.googleusercontent.com%2Fdocsz%2FAD_4nXcyyGwrA8O9fGrkMqXD5AaL42vQs61QrpPONBOh3QpMKIE9jKJBSwltK5fbSFiWd4HSJ1cTQTZrDQydgqwrDUH9c0TY89tKvfCqUdSb8-D7kmnj6tCEmdFgkznesfgjpriA-Z967w%3Fkey%3DX9ufQokfM1ptN6DlBnsiCkwI) attached.
